# General Best Practices for Developing Microservices

The following list is a collection of best practices you should take into consideration before you start developing and deploying microservices on top of Cumulocity.

Whenever possible, use the Cumulocity Microservice SDK as it builds a lot of functionality. It is fully open source and can be extended as required. The Cumulocity Microservice SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/Cumulocity-IoT/cumulocity-clients-java). See also Microservice SDK for Java for further instructions.

Do not use a local disk, store everything in Cumulocity. You do not have a guaranteed amount of bandwidth for disk I/O and also not guaranteed capacity.

Liveness probes should be exposed to Kubernetes as well, only having a health endpoint is not sufficient. Moreover, take special attention on implementing liveness probes properly. Kubernetes will restart or undeploy the service if the liveness probe is not reliable. Never check 3rd parties in the liveness probe - this can prevent the service from working.

It is not recommended to build a microservice that loads most of the functionality as well as external content on start.

Resource consumption should be defined as necessary in the microservice manifest. Resource consumption has an impact on billing. Also consider carefully how many resources you will need in a production scenario per microservice started.

There is currently no way to influence load balancer behaviour for scaled microservices, for details on scaling see Isolation and scaling. The behaviour is round-robin. Refer to Microservice manifest for further information on how to configure scaling in the manifest file cumulocity.json.

When building microservices for multiple tenants, try to build them in the multi-tenant isolation level, see Isolation and scaling.

Avoid statefulness wherever possible, rather write data via REST requests or DB to a persistent shared storage. You can actually find statelessness as one of the requirements listed under Requirements and interactions.

Do not develop or test on a production platform.
You should develop in a local environment before even deploying something in a development or test cluster.
Use existing development platforms to test your microservices before rolling them out to any production system.

# General Best Practices for Microservice Architecture & Desing in Cumulocity


The following isolation levels are available for microservices:

Multi-tenant: Single microservice Docker container instantiated for all subscribed tenants, unless the microservice is scaled.
Single-tenant: Dedicated microservice Docker container instantiated for each subscribed tenant.
See [Settings](https://cumulocity.com/docs/microservice-sdk/general-aspects/#settings) for the isolation setting.

In case the scale setting is set to NONE, the platform guarantees that there is one instance of the service per isolation level by default. The number of guaranteed instances can be increased by defining the replicas setting in the manifest. If scaling is enabled (set to AUTO), the microservice will be horizontally auto-scaled (creating more instances of the microservice) in case of high CPU usage. Auto-scaling monitors the microservices to make sure that they are operating at the desired performance levels, and it will automatically scale up your cluster as soon as you need it and scale it back down when you don’t.

See [Settings](https://cumulocity.com/docs/microservice-sdk/general-aspects/#settings) for the scale and replicas setting.
  

You are aware of the Cumulocity microservice manifest file (cumulocity.json) and its settings. See detailed information about the manifest file in [Microservice manifest](https://cumulocity.com/docs/microservice-sdk/general-aspects/#microservice-manifest).


Most microservices will expose REST APIs to interact with other services or clients. Follow RESTful principles when designing your APIs, including using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, and resource naming conventions. HTTP methods (PATCH, OPTIONS) are not allowed and will not be routed by the Cumulocity API Gateway.

It is recommended to align your REST API design with Cumulocity's existing API structure to ensure consistency and ease of integration. For Example use similar pagination and filtering mechanism as Cumulocity REST API.

Pagination with currentPage and pageSize parameters and statistics in the response:

Example: /inventory/managedObjects?currentPage=2&pageSize=1

```json
{
  "managedObjects": [
    {
      "id": "12345",
      "name": "Device A",
      "type": "c8y_Device",
      "creationTime": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "statistics": {
    "currentPage": 2,
    "pageSize": 1
  }
}
```


When designing data models for your microservices, consider the following best practices:

- Use Cumulocity's existing data models and extensions where possible to ensure compatibility and leverage built-in functionality.
  - Use measurement for time-series data. Measurements can only cary number values!
  - Use events for discrete occurrences or state changes. Events are mulitporpose class for all data which is time related but is not a measurement.
  - Use alarms for monitoring and alerting purposes. Alarms have specific states (ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED, CLEARED) and severity levels. Can be used for device alarm or application alarm.
  - Use operations for commands or actions to be executed on devices.
  - Use managed objects (Inventory) for all master data or meta data of your devices and assets which has no time related aspect.
  - Use tenant options for storing tenant-specific configuration settings. This can be used for all kind of configuration data.
  - Use binary managed objects for storing files and large data blobs.
- Define clear relationships between entities using references and associations. Use childDevices for hierarchical relationships between managed objects which represent devices. Use childAssets for hierarchical relationships between managed objects which represent assets. For all other relationships use childAddtiions.
- Use naming conventions that align with Cumulocity's standards. Apply folowing naming conventions:
  - General: prefix custom types and elements. For example, use "yourCompany_" or "yourDevice_" as a prefix to avoid naming collisions. Keep the prefix consistent across all custom types and short (2 - 4 characters). For example your company name is "Acme Corp", you can use "ac_" as prefix.
- The documents (json) should not exceed 16MB in size. For larger data sets consider dividing the data and link them via childAdditions references. Another option is to use binary API of Cumulocity. Here you can store large files but consider that binary files get not offloead to datahub.
- The design of your data is crucial for performance and scalability. Optimize your data models for efficient querying and retrieval.
